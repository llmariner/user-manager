[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/user-manager-server)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=user-manager-server)

The user-manager-server is a sub-component of [LLMariner](https://github.com/llmariner/llmariner). It manages user information for the LLMariner. See [Technical Details](https://llmariner.ai/docs/dev/architecture/) document for details.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a subcomponent, so it is typically not installed on its own except for testing. See [Installation](https://llmariner.ai/docs/setup/install/) guide for LLMariner installation.
